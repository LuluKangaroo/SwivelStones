# SwivelStones
Match-3 PC game by Lu Liu, Jacob Berman, Josef Los, and Hongyi Chen 

## Project Overview
In this game the player will attempt match as many stones as possible within the given time limit. Afterwards the number of stones matched will be recorded in a high score system. You can compete with your friends to try and be at the top of the leader board. 

## Files Included
All of the game files we wrote will be included in the assets folder.

* The Graphics folder contains all the graphics for our game objects
* The Scripts folder contains all of the scripts that we attatch to those objects. These files contain the classes we wrote and their associated methods
* The scenes folder contains all of the scenes for the different screens in our game. All of these are linked together to create the menus
* The Resources folder contains our prefabs which are instantiated during the runtime of the game.
